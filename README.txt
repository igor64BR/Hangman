Thanks for your attention!

This is a fun Hangman game to play with friends or relatives in special dates. It is also a great tool for kids education.

This game is very easy to set:
1- To chose the words or sentences to be displayed during the game, someone must add it to the word_list in
   'main_hangman_words.py' (always use '' or "" when setting the word/sentence and remember always to insert a , after
   the set - e.g.: 'Sentence1', "word2", 'etc', ... - or else the game will not be able to run)

2- The sentences in the word_list will be chosen randomly

3- Press Enter to start the game and then just start guessing the letters (1 letter per guessing)

OBS.: The missing letters will not be printed in the game and on the end, the correct sentence will be printed in the
console

I really hope you to enjoy!
